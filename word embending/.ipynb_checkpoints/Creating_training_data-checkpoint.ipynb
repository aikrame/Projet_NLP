In this manuscript we show how the same conceptual approach can be exploited to devise a new smoothing method, called turbo smoothing. A turbo smoother combines a turbo filter, employed in its forward pass, with the parallel concatenation of two backward information filters used in its backward pass. As a specific application of our general theory, a detailed derivation of two turbo smoothing algorithms for conditionally linear Gaussian systems is illustrated. Numerical results for a specific dynamic system evidence that these algorithms can achieve a better complexity-accuracy tradeoff than other smoothing techniques recently appeared in the literature.</th>\n",

This problem arises in the contexts of simultaneous inference, the selection and ranking of populations and in the evaluation of multivariate t probabilities. It also arises in the assessment of the coverage probability and expected volume properties of the some non-standard confidence regions. We use a transformation put forward by Mori, followed by the application of the trapezoidal rule. This rule has the remarkable property that, for suitable integrands, it is exponentially convergent. We use it to create a nested sequence of quadrature rules, for the estimation of the approximation error, so that previous evaluations of the integrand are not wasted. The application of the trapezoidal rule requires the approximation of an infinite sum by a finite sum. We provide a new easily computed upper bound on the error of this approximation. Our overall conclusion is that this method is a very suitable candidate for the computation of the coverage and expected volume properties of non-standard confidence regions.</th>\n",

Understanding the role of ecological memory in shaping ecosystem responses to disturbance under global change is a critical step toward developing effective adaptive management strategies to maintain ecosystem function and biodiversity. We developed EcoMem, an R package for quantifying ecological memory functions using common environmental time series data (continuous, count, proportional) applying a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The package estimates memory functions for continuous and binary (e.g., disturbance chronology) variables making no a priori assumption on the form of the functions. EcoMem allows users to quantify ecological memory for a wide range of ecosystem processes and responses. The utility of the package to advance understanding of the memory of ecosystems to environmental drivers is demonstrated using a simulated dataset and a case study assessing the memory of boreal tree growth to insect defoliation.</th>\n",

(2017) and vertex bootstrap of Snijders and Borgatti (1999). To our knowledge, the new R package snowboot is the first implementation of the vertex and patchwork bootstrap inference on networks in R. Our new package is accompanied with a detailed user's manual, and is compatible with the popular R package on network studies igraph.

In this paper we explain how to construct the Hamiltonian system on naturally reductive homogeneous spaces using symplectic reduction, which lifts the HMC scheme to a matrix Lie group with global coordinates and constant metric. This provides a general framework that is applicable to many manifolds that arise in applications, such as hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, symmetric positive-definite matrices, Grassmannian, and Stiefel manifolds.</th>\n",
